Jee as a trilobed puzzle

Well jee can be regarded as "tri-lobed puzzle" or "tri lobed" rubiks cube if you say.
the three lobes presetn PJhysics , cheistry, maths.

Now just like the rubiks cube has faces , our jee puzzle too has faces, or to say each subject has its own faces . Each face has sides. and just like you solve each side of the runiks cube in an attempt to solve the whoel cube. You also solve jee puzzle in a likewise manner, that is, each lobe consists of many small sides/faces which are chapters. 

Just like you solve chpaters, you solve faces of the cube.

Now How to not be lonely ?

Pick up a puzzle and try to start it. Time passes just like. 
You wont feel lonely cause you are so engrossed in that thing. Actually Loneliness is a feeling , which can be be avoided if you don't feel it or rather avoid feeling it. And the way to do that is by being occupied in something so intresting to the mind that it's forget its surroundings.
So if I consider jee as a puzzle , as a challnege and i have to solve it , I get immeresed in it so as to solve it any how. IN this process, I rarely think about eating, sleeping, talking to someone, etc. My mind is completely taken over by the thoughts of the puzzle and how to make it possible. How to solve it . Like literally anyhow, I read and I search until I get to know here I have been mistaken. 

So ya , from now instead of considering this as a "prep", I will consider this as a tri lobed puzzle which I do anything to solve.
